“I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up <br> 
for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of  my life. Since completing 
the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working  as  a Software Engineer at a VR startup.”

  an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”

  “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
  professionals <br> who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to <br> enroll by a former 
  student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
  did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
  project, in <br> particular, was outstanding. It took <br> my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
  could ever have. In <br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
  experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
  100% recommend! ”
